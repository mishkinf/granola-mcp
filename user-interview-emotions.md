## Key Insight

The root cause of negative emotions is **dealer behavior** - not the buyer's identity or circumstances. Specific dealer behaviors that trigger negative emotions:

1. **Information asymmetry** - Dealers know more and use it as leverage
2. **Pressure tactics** - Rushing decisions, not giving time to think
3. **Condescension** - Talking down, assuming ignorance
4. **Targeting** - Treating certain buyers as "easy marks"
5. **Lack of transparency** - Hidden fees, unclear pricing, refusing to negotiate
6. **Dismissiveness** - Not taking buyers seriously, talking past them to companions
